Hello! I am an undergraduate at UC Davis studying Genetics and Genomics and graduating in Spring 2022. 
Currently, I am working in the Ross-Ibarra Lab investigating genome size variation as environmental adaptation in _Tripsacum dactyloides_. 
I am learning bash, R and some python (for workflow manager Snakemake) to accomplish this!
I am broadly interested in using genomics to understand the evolution and ecology of endangered species and apply this to their conservation.
