Hello! 

I am working as a Junior Specialist for Dr. Rachael Bay at UC Davis. I'm currently working on a project detecting copy number variants
in owl limpets, *Lottia gigantea*, which are currently undergoing a northward range expansion following marine heatwaves in 2014-2016. 

I graduated from UC Davis with a BS in Genetics and Genomics in June 2022. I am continuing to work on my undergraduate research project on genome size variation associated with altitude in the eastern gammagrass, *Tripsacum dactyloides*. I hope to publish a paper on this work within the next couple years. 

I am broadly interested in using genomics to understand how ecological and evolutionary process are affected by climate change. I would like to apply this research to the conservation of species.
